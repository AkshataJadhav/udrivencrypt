Workflows
=========

**1. Workflow to encrypt USB Drive**
        When udrivencrypt is launched, the main window will have three checkboxes - ‘Encrypt USB drive’, ‘Add keys’ and ‘Delete keys’. The 
        checkbox Encrypt USB drive is selected by default and thus it’s options are available. To encrypt USB drive, first select that particular
        USB drive from the drop down list displaying all the connected USB drives (both encrypted and unencrypted). Then click on the ‘Format’ 
        button.
        If the USB drive is already encrypted, clicking on ‘Format’ will pop up a message saying “To format disk you need to enter user password.
        Do you want to continue?”. Click ‘yes’ to continue. Then enter a passwordof your choice and confirm it by entering again in the other 
        texbox and continue. Now you’ll be prompted to enter the mapper name. Your USB drivewill be renamed to this name.

**2. Workflow to add new key to encrypted devices**
        Now if you wish to add new key to the USB drive, check the checkbox ‘Add keys’. Maximum of 8 keys can be added to one USB drive. For this
        you’ll have to first enter any existing password of the USB drive. Now enter new password and verify by entering it again. Click on 
        ‘Finish’ to complete this operation.

**3. Workflow to delete an existing key from encrypted devices**
        To delete one of the existing password, check the checkbox ‘Delete keys’. Enter password that you want to delete. Click on ‘Finish’ to 
        complete this operation.
